ENUMERATE


- Zone Transfers
- SMB Windows Enum
- Null session testing
- Blindly Mapping Internal Networks: https://blog.netspi.com/10-techniques-for-blindly-mapping-internal-networks/
NMAP

nmap -sn 38.100.193.0-250

Fast scan top 100 ports:  nmap -F 192.168.1.1

Use greppable output flag (-oG) and scan results to file:
nmap -sn 38.100.193.40-100 -oG pingSweepNmap

cut out just the IPs of hosts that are up:
grep Up pingSweepNmap | cut -d" " -f2


OS/Banner grab :
nmap -A 38.100.193.40

TCP Window Scan (-sW) - for stuff behind firewall

NETCAT
Netcat can be used to see:
- if single port is open or closed: $ nc -zv 192.168.1.15 22
- if multiple ports are open or closed: $ nc -zv 192.168.56.10 20-80
- read a banner from a port 
- connect & interact with a network service manually
